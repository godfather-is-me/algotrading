# Define goals - it is the equation they gave

# Checks for whether there are holdlings available in the private and public market before making and buy or sell order
# Try using the last executed price to make your strategy

# The need for current orders is still vague. (One thing used is to check whether your order is in the system or not)
    # If possible, understand the minimum selling price, maximum buying price and if opportunity exists within both execute at that point, else just place order and wait for reaction

# --- learnt
# received_holdings keeps upadating with every change in the market

# Make send order function with buy/sell and price params
